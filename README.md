  <b>NocturnalHuman</b> is an <b>event sharing, social App</b> that allows users to find friends with common interests and hang out at night. Users can either play as as applicant to join other's events or become a host themselves to throw a desired party. Through browsing other's events, applicants can send applicant to the host, and the hosts could determine if they want to let the applicant join. If hosts and applicants have further questions to ask each other, they can start a real time conversation whenever they want!
